			<img src="hydro.jpg" class="img1">
			<p>Water is pretty powerful stuff! You know this if you have stood in a flowing stream and felt the water
				rushing past you. Or, if you've gone whitewater rafting down a raging river. Even mere images of a place
				like Niagara Falls help you appreciate just how strong moving water is. This is not a new observation,
				and water has been used to produce different forms of energy for a very long time. When electricity is
				generated from flowing water, this is called hydroelectric energy, and the prefix 'hydro' refers to
				water.
				Hydroelectric energy is considered a renewable energy resource because it's an energy resource that
				regenerates in a short time period. You can think of this like the hair on your head. If you get a bad
				haircut that you don't like, you don't have to worry about it too much because it will grow back in a
				reasonable amount of time. However, if you lose an arm, you certainly can't regenerate that! Your hair
				is a renewable resource, whereas your arm is a non-renewable resource.
				Sunlight, wind and heat generated from the earth are similar types of renewable energy resources. Just
				like you can't stop water from flowing, you can't stop the sun from shining or the wind from blowing.
				The resource 'renews' itself as it is used, and unlike things such as minerals and metals, does not
				occur on Earth in a limited supply.

				<h2>Uses of Hydroelectric Energy</h2>
				<p>Hydropower is energy collected from flowing water that's converted into electricity or used to power
					machinery. Hydropower has been around for centuries, used to turn millwheels or drive early
					industrial machinery, but in modern use it typically refers to electrical generation. Today
					hydropower generates more electricity in the United States than any other renewable energy source,
					and the Department of Energy's Wind and Water Power Program promotes and accelerates its use
					throughout the country. For businesses, hydro offers recruiting benefits alongside a cost-effective
					and plentiful source of green energy.
